# My Awesome Website

Welcome to the GitHub repository for my personal website, hosted with GitHub Pages. This repository contains all the source code used to build and manage my site.

## About

This website is built with Jekyll, a static site generator, and uses the Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme. It includes a blog, about me page, contact information, and showcases my portfolio of work.

## Local Setup

Follow the steps below to set up a local development environment:

1. **Install Ruby** - Jekyll is a Ruby Gem, and Ruby is required to use it. Install Ruby via [RubyInstaller](https://rubyinstaller.org/) (for Windows) or via Homebrew (`brew install ruby`) on Mac.
2. **Install Jekyll** - Open your command line interface and install Jekyll by running `gem install jekyll bundler`.
3. **Fork and Clone the Repository** - Fork this repository, then clone or download it to your local machine.
4. **Install Dependencies** - In your command line, navigate to your cloned repository's directory and run `bundle install` to install necessary dependencies.
5. **Build and Serve Locally** - From the same directory, build and serve your website by running `bundle exec jekyll serve`. You should be able to view your site at `localhost:4000`.
